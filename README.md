A **HTML5 Canvas** Game and Simulator with random humans drawn in SVG. Every humans/zombies has aleatory moves (up, right,left,down) and every one has one random audio talk.

## Online Test

## Extremely lightweight
#### SVG
All the images are actually SVG, leaving this game lightly light.
#### OGG
All audios are in the OGG format (Ogg Vorbis).


## Game Dynamics
1. When you touch the screen, you add a human;
2. Every human who was touched by a **zombie**, turns a zombie too;
3. Every zombie walk more slow than a human;
4. Every zombie who touch a human says something;
5. Every human say a random phrase in a random volume;
6. When the last human is touched, the game stop;
7. If you use some keyborad arrow, W,A,D,S, or touch/click the joystic, a **blonde boy** will appear as your player;
8. When your player is contamined, you lose control of it;
9. The time stop when everyone is a zombie.
